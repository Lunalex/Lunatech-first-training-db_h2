## H2 DATABASE - how to launch ?

in the terminal go to the "/bin" folder
then type: java -jar h2*.jar

it will open a web page in your browser
click on "Connect" (or "Connecter" in French)
once it has loaded the next page you can close it: H2 database has been launched!

Do not stop the terminal you launched the Db from, as all the processing is happening from there.
